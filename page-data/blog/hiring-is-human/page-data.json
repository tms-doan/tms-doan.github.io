Great. Welcome aboard.\"</em></strong></p>\n<p>But that’s not what happened.</p>\n<p>The conversation flowed.\r\n<em><strong>One hour</strong></em> went by — without me even noticing.\r\nWe didn’t just talk about technical skills; we talked about ideas.\r\nHow they see UX, how we think about product.\r\nWe talked about culture, work philosophy, and the kinds of values we wanted to protect as the team grew.\r\nWe even laughed about random startup chaos stories (because who hasn’t experienced that?).</p>\n<p>By the end of it, I realized something important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Hiring isn’t about judgment.</em></li>\n<li><em>It’s about connection.</em></li>\n<li><em>It’s about building a bridge between people and business — not just measuring skills on a spreadsheet.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m not even sure if the candidate ended up getting the offer.\r\nBut for me, the experience itself was already a win.\r\nI had stepped way outside my comfort zone.\r\nI had grown.\r\nAnd I had learned that even if you feel nervous, imperfect, or unqualified,\r\nyou can still create a real, human connection — and that’s what matters most.</p>\n<p>This experience taught me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At the end of the day, hiring is human.</li>\n<li>It’s about empathy.</li>\n<li>It’s about seeing possibility in someone, and offering them a glimpse of the story you’re trying to write together.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And for a guy who never thought he’d survive an English interview as <em><strong>“the face of the company,”</strong></em>\r\nThat felt like a pretty good first step.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My First Hiring Experience - Learning That Hiring Is Human","description":"I got asked to do something I had never done","date":"2025-04-30T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/hiring-is-human","tags":["HR","Culture"]}}},"pageContext":{}},
